# Nexur.ai

Nexur.ai is an AI-powered storytelling application that generates stories based on user prompts and selected emotions. The application utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for text generation, DALL·E for image generation, and OpenAI's TTS-1 for text-to-speech synthesis.

## Features

- **Prompt-based Story Generation**: Users can input prompts for the AI storyteller to create stories.
- **Emotion Selection**: Users can select the emotion they want the generated story to convey, influencing the storytelling tone.
- **Image Generation**: The application generates images based on the generated story using DALL·E, enhancing the storytelling experience.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Nexur.ai converts the generated story into audio using OpenAI's TTS-1 model, allowing users to listen to the story.
- **Interactive User Interface**: The user interface is intuitive and interactive, making it easy for users to input prompts, select emotions, and generate stories.

## How to Use

1. **Input Prompt**: Enter a prompt for the AI storyteller in the provided text area.
2. **Select Emotion**: Choose the emotion you want the story to convey from the dropdown list.
3. **Capture Emotion (Optional)**: Click on the "Capture Emotion" button to capture the user's emotion through an image input.
4. **Generate Story**: Click on the "Generate Story" button to generate the story based on the input prompt and selected emotion.
5. **Explore Generated Content**: Explore the generated story, images, and audio. Images are displayed along with the story, and the audio can be played by clicking the audio player.
